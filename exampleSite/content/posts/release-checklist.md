Use this checklist before tagging a Hugo theme release.

## Pick the version

Choose the next semantic version, for example `0.2.0`.

There is no separate version file. The git tag is the source of truth for Linewise releases.

## Run checks

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Review theme metadata

Check these files before tagging:

```text
theme.toml
go.mod
README.md
images/screenshot.png
exampleSite/content/posts/theme-reference.md
```

## Check upgrade notes

Document breaking changes when any of these change:

- public keys under `[params.linewise]`
- documented partial override points
- shortcodes
- generated route behavior
- `/search.json` shape

## Tag and push

```sh
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Tags are the source of truth for released theme versions. Create GitHub Releases manually if they become useful later.
